# **Notes For HTML & JS**

## **List & Boxes in HTML**

**we need sometimes to design our website to make it easiear to read and browse, also to make the visitors enjoying when go around the pages.**

thats why we need the**list**and**boxes**

### **List**

**we have three type of List:**

* **Ordered lists** _are lists where each item in the list is numbered
For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number_

     _The ordered list is created with the <ol> element._
* **Bullet lists:** _Unordered lists are lists that begin with a          bullet
 point (rather than characters that indicate order)._

      _The unordered list is created with the <ul> element._

* **Definition lists:** _are made up of a set of terms along with the
 definitions for each of those terms._
 _The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions._

       _Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements._

### **Boxer**

**CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.**

**the box size is large enough to hold its contents. to Set your dimensions for square you can use height and Display properties.**

     _To determine the size of the box Use pixels, percentages, or EMS_

### **Type Of Statements**

* **Block statement**

* **Conditional statements:** _A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements:_

  **1) if else:** _Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false_

## JavaScript Functions

**a JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**

**a JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).**

**_A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().**

**Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).**

**The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)**

**The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}**
