# Using WebSocket to build an interactive web application

What is WebSocket and how does it function?
A WebSocket is a client-server connection that remains open throughout time. Through a single TCP/IP socket connection, WebSockets enable a bidirectional, full-duplex communications channel that functions over HTTP. The WebSocket protocol permits message transmission between a client and a server at its core.

Spring Initializr
Gradle:
```
dependencies {
implementation 'org.webjars:webjars-locator-core'
implementation 'org.webjars:sockjs-client:1.0.2'
implementation 'org.webjars:stomp-websocket:2.3.3'
implementation 'org.webjars:bootstrap:3.3.7'
implementation 'org.webjars:jquery:3.1.1-1'
}
```

## Create a Resource Representation Class

You can now setup your STOMP messaging service after you've set up the project and build system.

Consider service interactions to start the process.

1. The service will accept STOMP messages with a name in the body that are JSON objects.
2. To model the message, develop a simple Java object containing a field name and a getName method ().

3. After extracting the name from the message, the service will handle it by constructing a greeting and publishing it on a separate queue to which the client has subscribed. The greeting will be a JSON object as well.

4. Add another plain old Java object with a content field and a getContent() method to model the greeting representation.

### Create a Message-handling Controller

STOMP messages can be routed to @Controller classes.

```
@Controller
public class GreetingController {


 @MessageMapping("/hello")
 @SendTo("/topic/greetings")
 public Greeting greeting(HelloMessage message) throws Exception {
   Thread.sleep(1000); // simulated delay
   return new Greeting("Hello, " + HtmlUtils.htmlEscape(message.getName()) + "!");
 }

}
```

## Configure Spring for STOMP messaging

```
@Configuration
@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
public class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {

  @Override
  public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) {
    config.enableSimpleBroker("/topic");
    config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes("/app");
  }

  @Override
  public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
    registry.addEndpoint("/gs-guide-websocket").withSockJS();
  }

}
```

### Create a Browser Client

Now that the server-side parts are in place, you can focus on the JavaScript client, which will send and receive messages from the server.

Make a file called index.html.

This HTML file imports the javascript libraries SockJS and STOMP, which will be used to communicate with our server using STOMP over websocket. We also include app.js, which contains our client application's functionality.
