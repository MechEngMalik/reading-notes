# Spring Boot and OAuth2

OAuth2 is an authorization system that allows the Web Security application to access client resources. We must concentrate on the Grant Type (Authorization code), Client ID, and Client secret when developing an OAuth2 application.

## Single Sign On With GitHub

You'll make a simple application that leverages GitHub for authentication in this part. Taking advantage of Spring Boot's autoconfiguration features will make this a breeze.

### Creating a New Project

To begin, you must first establish a Spring Boot application, which can be accomplished in a variety of ways. The simplest way is to create an empty project at https://start.spring.io (choosing the "Web" dependency as a starting point). Do the following on the command line:

```
mkdir ui && cd ui
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz -d style=web -d name=simple | tar -xzvf -COPY
```

The project may then be imported into your favorite IDE (it's a standard Maven Java project by default), or you can simply work with the files and mvn on the command line.

### Generating a 401 in the Server

If the user can't or won't login with GitHub, Spring Security will send a 401 response, thus the app will continue to run even if you fail to authenticate (e.g. by rejecting the token grant).

You may spice things up by extending the authentication rule to reject users who do not belong to the correct organization.

To learn more about the user, you can use the GitHub API; all you have to do now is plug it into the appropriate phase of the authentication procedure.

Fortunately, Spring Boot has provided an easy extension point for such a simple use case: create a @Bean of type OAuth2UserService, and it will be used to identify the user principal.
