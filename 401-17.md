# Application Fundamentals

Kotlin, Java, and C++ are all languages that can be used to create Android apps. Your code, along with any data and resource files, is compiled into an APK or Android App Bundle using the Android SDK tools.

Each Android app has its own security sandbox, which is secured by the Android security mechanisms listed below:

* The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system, with each app representing a unique user. The system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID by default (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). All files in an app are given permissions by the system so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them. Because each process runs in its own virtual machine (VM), an app's code executes independently of other programs. Every app runs in its own Linux process by default. When any of the app's components has to be run, the Android system launches the process, and then shuts it down when it's no longer needed or when the system needs to recover memory.

## App components

The main building pieces of an Android app are app components. Each component is a point of entry for the system or a user inside your app. Some elements are reliant on others.

App components can be divided into four categories:

* Extracurricular activities

* Providers

* Receivers of broadcasts

* Content creators

Each type has its own purpose and lifespan, which describes how the component is created and removed. The four categories of app components are described in the sections below.

### The manifest file

The Android system needs to know that an app component exists before it can start it by scanning the app's manifest file, AndroidManifest.xml. This file, which must be located in the root of the app project directory, must declare all of your app's components.

Aside from declaring the app's components, the manifest does a variety of other things, such as the following:

* Any user rights that the app requires, such as Internet access or read-only access to the user's contacts, are listed here.

* Based on whatever APIs the app utilizes, declares the minimum API Level required by the app.

* Indicates which hardware and software features the app uses or requires, such as a camera, Bluetooth services, or a multitouch screen.

* Indicates which API libraries (other than the Android framework APIs) the app needs to be linked to, such as the Google Maps library.
