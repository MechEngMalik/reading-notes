# GraphQL @connection

## Serverless

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider oversees the allocation and provisioning of servers on a dynamic basis. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-driven, ephemeral (lasting only one invocation), and controlled entirely by the cloud provider.

### AWS Amplify

It's a collection of tools and services that may be used together or separately to assist front-end web and mobile developers in developing scalable full stack apps.

Users can create app backends and link apps in minutes with Amplify, deploy static web apps in a few clicks with Amplify, and manage app content outside of the AWS dashboard with Amplify.

### Add relationships between types

### @connection

* You can use the @connection directive to define relationships between @model types. Currently, one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-one relationships are supported.

* Many-to-many relationships can be implemented with two one-to-many connections and a connecting @model type.

### Usage

Type relationships are defined by using the @connection directive to annotate fields on a @model object type.

The fields option can be used to specify which fields should be queried in order to obtain related objects. Optionally, the keyName argument can be used to give the name of a secondary index (an index created using @key) that should be queried from the relationship's other type.

The fields parameter should be provided when supplying a keyName to indicate which field(s) will be used to fetch related items. If keyName isn't specified, @connection looks up the primary index of the target table.

### Relations

* Has one

* Has many


a one-to-many connection requires a @key to query comments by postID, and the connection utilizes this key to retrieve all comments whose postID is the id of the post that was called on.

* Belongs to

* Many-to-many relationships

Two 1-M @connections, a @key, and a joining @model can be used to implement many to many. Consider the following scenario:

### Limit

The number of nested items is set to 100 by default. The limit argument can be used to overrule this behavior.

### Generates

When you use @connection, the GraphQL transform controls global secondary indexes (GSIs) on the created tables on your behalf to keep connection queries fast and efficient.
