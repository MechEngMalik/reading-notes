_our mind is the engine of our body and control our movment and reactions and feelings in our life
and to make our enviroment full of posetive energy and keep walking over proplems and obstecels we need something called growth mindest_ 
### What's the difference between fixed mindest and growth mindest
* **fixed mindest:** _people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success_
* **growth mindest:** _people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed with dedication and hard workâ€”brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment._
