# Java

**Java** _is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable_

## Language Basics

### Variables

The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:

* **Instance Variables** (Non-Static Fields)
_fields declared without the static keyword. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class_

* **Class Variables** (Static Fields)
_any field declared with the static modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence_

* **Local Variables**
_a method will often store its temporary state in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to declaring a field (for example, int count = 0;)._
_local variables are **only** visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class._

* **Parameters**
_parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields". This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well_

### Primitive Data Types

**all variables must first be declared before they can be used. This involves stating the variable's type and name,**

_The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:_

* **byte:**
_data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127_

* **short:**
_data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767_

* **int:**
_data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of 2^31.

* **long:**
 _data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63._

* **float:**
 _data type in Java stores a decimal value with 6-7 total digits of precision. So, for example, 12.12345 can be saved as a float, but 12.123456789 can't be saved as a float_

* **boolean:**
_data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions._

### Operators

* **The Arithmetic Operators**
_The Java programming language provides operators that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division_

|Operator|Description|
|------------|-------------|
|+ |Additive operator (also used for String concatenation)|
|-|Subtraction operator|
|*|Multiplication operator|
|/|Division operator|
|%|Remainder operator|

* **The Unary Operators**
_The unary operators require only one operand; they perform various operations such as incrementing/decrementing a value by one, negating an expression, or inverting the value of a boolean._

|Operator|Description|
|------------|-------------|
|+ | Unary plus operator; indicates positive value (numbers are positive without this, however)|
|-| Unary minus operator; negates an expression|
|++|Increment operator; increments a value by 1
|--|Decrement operator; decrements a value by 1|
|!| Logical complement operator; inverts the value of a boolean|

* **The Equality and Relational Operators**

|Operator|Description|
|------------|-------------|
|== |equal to|
|!=|not equal to|
|>|greater than|
|>=|greater than or equal to|
|<|less than|

* **Conditional Operators**

|Operator|Description|
|------------|-------------|
|&& |Conditional-AND|
||| |Conditional-OR|
|?: |Ternary (shorthand for if-then-else statement)|

* **Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators**

|Operator|Description|
|------------|-------------|
|~|Unary bitwise complement|
|<<| Signed left shift|
|>>|Signed right shift|
|>>>|nsigned right shifto|
|&|Bitwise AND|
|^|Bitwise exclusive OR|
|||Bitwise inclusive OR|

### Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

* **Expressions**
_An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value._

* **Statements**
_Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semicolon_

* **Blocks**
_A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed._

## if-then and if-then-else Statements

* **The if-then Statement**
_to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true._

* **The if-then-else Statement**
_The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an "if" clause evaluates to false. You could use an if-then-else statement in the applyBrakes method to take some action if the brakes are applied when the bicycle is not in motion. In this case, the action is to simply print an error message stating that the bicycle has already stopped._

## The switch Statement

the switch statement can have a number of possible execution paths. A switch works with the byte, short, char, and int primitive data types. It also works with enumerated types

## The while and do-while Statements

The while statement continually executes a block of statements while a particular condition is true. Its syntax can be expressed as:

while (expression) {
     statement(s)
}
The while statement evaluates expression, which must return a boolean value. If the expression evaluates to true, the while statement executes the statement(s) in the while block. The while statement continues testing the expression and executing its block until the expression evaluates to false

## The for Statement

The for statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. Programmers often refer to it as the "for loop" because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied. The general form of the for statement can be expressed as follows:

for (initialization; termination;
     increment) {
    statement(s)
}
![for](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20191108131134/For-Loop.jpg)

**notes on (for) statment**

* The initialization expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.

* When the termination expression evaluates to false, the loop terminates.

* The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment or decrement a value.

## Compiling
_everything in a computer is represented by a series of 1's and 0's (which themselves represent high and low voltages on transistors, but that's a topic for another time). When the computer runs a program, the program itself is made of a bunch of 1's and 0's._

_putting everything in 1's and 0's (called machine language) would be very difficult. So we made higher level languages like Java and C# to write code in. These languages look a lot more like English, so they're a lot easier to write and maintain._

_When  compiling code, the compilor (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand (i.e. converts from Java to machine language). The very short version could be, yes, compile means to make the code executable._

 _code does or does not compile. This means the compilor they used checks to make sure their program is written correctly according to the rules of the programming language. For example, most programming languages make you put a semicolon at the end of every line. A very common mistake is to forget that semicolon, so when you try and compile the compilor gives you an error._
