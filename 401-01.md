# Java

**Java** _is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable_

## Language Basics

### Variables

The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:

* **Instance Variables** (Non-Static Fields)
_fields declared without the static keyword. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class_

* **Class Variables** (Static Fields)
_any field declared with the static modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence_

* **Local Variables**
_a method will often store its temporary state in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to declaring a field (for example, int count = 0;)._
_local variables are **only** visible to the methods in which they are declared; they are not accessible from the rest of the class._

* **Parameters**
_parameters are always classified as "variables" not "fields". This applies to other parameter-accepting constructs as well_

### Primitive Data Types

**all variables must first be declared before they can be used. This involves stating the variable's type and name,**

_The eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:_

* **byte:**
_data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127_

* **short:**
_data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767_

* **int:**
_data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of 2^31.

* **long:**
 _data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63._

* **float:**
 _data type in Java stores a decimal value with 6-7 total digits of precision. So, for example, 12.12345 can be saved as a float, but 12.123456789 can't be saved as a float_

* **boolean:**
_data type has only two possible values: true and false. Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions._

## Operators

* Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.
_The Java programming language provides operators that perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division_

### Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

* **Expressions**
_An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value._

* **Statements**
_Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. The following types of expressions can be made into a statement by terminating the expression with a semicolon_

* **Blocks**
_A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed._

## Control Flow Statements

* The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear.
* Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

## Compiling

* _Compiling allows the computer to run and understand the program without the need of the programming software used to create it_
* _When you compile code, the compilor (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand_.
