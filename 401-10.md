# Spring MVC

* **A Spring MVC framework is a Java framework for developing web applications. The Model-View-Controller design pattern is used. It implements all of the core spring framework's basic functionalities, including as Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection.**

* **With the help of DispatcherServlet, Spring MVC provides an intuitive method for using MVC in the spring framework. DispatcherServlet is a class that receives requests and routes them to the appropriate resources, such as controllers, models, and views.**

The pieces of data that can be accessible during the execution of views model attributes are referred to as Spring MVC calls. Context variables is the Thymeleaf word for the same thing.

## Spring Boot Devtools

* Enables hot swapping.
* Switches template engines to disable caching.
* Enables LiveReload to automatically refresh the browser.
* Other reasonable defaults based on development instead of production.

## Testing Application :
* Testing the App can be easilty Done using the web browser after running the application by visit http://localhost:8080

## Spring model attributes

**These model properties (also known as context variables in Thymeleaf) can be accessed using the following syntax: $attributeName, where attributeName is messages in our example. This is an EL expression in Spring. Spring EL (Spring Expression Language) is a runtime language that allows you to query and manipulate an object graph.**

* The pieces of data that can be accessible during the execution of views model attributes are referred to as Spring MVC calls.
* Context variables is the Thymeleaf word for the same thing.
* In Spring MVC, there are numerous ways to add model characteristics to a view.
* Using the addAttribute method on Model, you may add an attribute to it:
* The method returns a Model and a View object.
@ModelAttribute returns all of the attributes in the message Repository.
* Thymeleaf templates may access all of these characteristics.
* The following syntax can be used to access model attributes from thymeleaf: $attribute name
* Using the param prefix, you can quickly access request parameters from a thyme leaf.
