# Tasks and the back stack

When users want to perform something in your app, they interact with a task, which is a collection of actions. These activities are stacked in the order that they are opened in a stack called the back stack. One action in an email app, for example, may be to display a list of fresh messages. A new activity appears when the user selects a message to view it. This new action has been added to the back of the queue. The new activity is then completed and popped off the stack if the user presses or gestures Back.

## Background and foreground tasks

Two tasks are shown in Figure 2. Task B is in the foreground, receiving user interaction, while Task A is in the background, waiting to be restarted.
When a user starts a new task or returns to the Home screen, a task might be moved to the background. All operations in the task are paused in the background, but the task's back stack remains intactâ€”the task has just lost focus while another task is being performed, as seen in figure 2. A task can then be brought back to the foreground, allowing users to continue where they left off.

## Defining launch modes

You can define how a new instance of an activity is related with the current task using launch modes. Different launch modes can be defined in two ways:

* Making use of the manifest file

You can specify how an activity should associate with tasks when it starts when you declare it in your manifest file.

* Making use of Intent flags

You can add a flag in the Intent when calling startActivity() that defines how (or whether) the new activity should associate with the existing task.

**The element's launchMode attribute in the manifest file can be used to describe how the activity should be associated with a task. There are four alternative launch modes that can be assigned to the launchMode attribute:**

1. standard
2. singleTop
3. singleTask
4. singleInstance

## Save key-value data

* SharedPreferences APIs: is an object that points to a file holding key-value pairs and provides easy read and write methods for them.
The framework manages SharedPreferences APIs, which can be private or shared.

By invoking one of these methods, we can create a new shared preference file or access an existing one:

getSharedPreferences is a function that returns a list of shared preferences ()

obtainPreferences ()

* How to Write to a Group of People's Preferences*

* Call edit() on your SharedPreferences to generate a SharedPreferences.Editor.

* Use methods like putInt() and putString() to pass the keys and values you want to write ().

* To save the modifications, use apply() or commit().

* call methods like getInt() and getString() to read from shared preferences. 
* provide the key for the value you want
* optionally a default value to return if the key isn't there
