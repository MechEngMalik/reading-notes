# **TEXT & COLOR**

**When creating a web page, you add tags(known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.**

## **Text**

### **Main Tags For Text**

* **<b> - Bold text** By enclosing words in the tags
    <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
* **<strong> - Important text** The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words
contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.
By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong>
element in bold.
* **<i> - Italic text** By enclosing words in the tag we can make characters appear italic.
* **<em> - Emphasized text** The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.By default browsers will show
the contents of an <em> elementin italic.
* **<br />** As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />.
* **<q>** The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within
a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around
the <q> element, however Internet Explorer does not â€” therefore many people avoid
* **<del> <ins>** The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it. The content of a <ins> element
is usually underlined, while the content of a <del> element usually has a line through it.
* **<sub> - Subscript text** The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.
* **<sup> - Superscript text** The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power

## COLORS

**Color can really bring your pages to life.**
**CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears insideits own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.**

**The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:**

* rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example:
 rgb(100,100,90)

* hex codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.
 For example:
 #ee3e80

* color names There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.
 For example: DarkCyan
