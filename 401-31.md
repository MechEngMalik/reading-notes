# Espresso

```
Espresso can be used to create Android UI tests that are brief, elegant, and reliable.

@Test
public void greeterSaysHello() {
    onView(withId(R.id.name_field)).perform(typeText("Steve"));
    onView(withId(R.id.greet_button)).perform(click());
    onView(withText("Hello Steve!")).check(matches(isDisplayed()));
}
```

Espresso tests are lightning fast! It allows you to leave your waits, syncs, sleeps, and polls behind while manipulating and asserting on the application UI.

## packages

* espresso-core - Contains core and basic View matchers, actions, and assertions. See Basics and Recipes.

* espresso-web - Contains resources for WebView support.

* espresso-idling-resource - Espresso's mechanism for synchronization with background jobs.

* espresso-contrib - External contributions that contain DatePicker, RecyclerView and Drawer actions, accessibility checks, and CountingIdlingResource.

* espresso-intents - Extension to validate and stub intents for hermetic testing.

* espresso-remote - Location of Espresso's multi-process functionality.

### 1. Record UI interactions

To start recording a test with Espresso Test Recorder, proceed as follows:

* Click Run > Record Espresso Test.

* In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to record the test.

* Espresso Test Recorder causes your project to be built, and you must first install and activate the app before you can interact with it. The Record Your Test window displays after the app launches, and the main panel reads "No events recorded yet" because you haven't interacted with the device yet. Start logging events like "tap" and "type" operations by interacting with your smartphone.

### 2. Add assertions to verify UI elements

Assertions verify the existence or contents of a View element through three main types:

* text is: Checks the text content of the selected View element.

* exists: Checks that the View element is present in the current View hierarchy visible on the screen.

* does not exist: Checks that the View element is not present in the current View hierarchy.

To add an assertion to your test, follow these steps:

1. Select Add Assertion from the drop-down menu. While Espresso obtains the UI hierarchy and other information about the current app state, a Screen Capture dialog appears. Once Espresso has captured the screenshot, the dialog closes automatically.

2. A panel on the right of the Record Your Test box displays a layout of the current screen. To construct an assertion on a View element, click on it in the snapshot or use the first drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box at the bottom of the window. In a red box, the selected View item is highlighted.

3. In the Edit assertion box, select the assertion you want to use from the second drop-down option. Espresso adds valid assertions for the selected View element to the menu.

* If you select the "text is" assertion, Espresso will automatically insert the text that is now within the specified View element. Using the text field in the Edit assertion box, you can change the text to fit your intended assertion.

4. To create another assertion, click Save and Add Another, or to exit the assertion panels, click Save Assertion.

### Save a recording

After you've finished interacting with your app and adding assertions, save your recording and produce the Espresso test by following the steps below:

1. Select Complete Recording from the drop-down menu. The window Select a test class name for your test displays.

2. Based on the name of the launched activity, Espresso Test Recorder offers your test a unique name within its package. If you want to change the suggested name, type it into the Test class name text area. Save the file.

3. Select Yes to add the dependencies to your build.gradle file automatically. After Espresso Test Recorder creates the file, Android Studio opens it and displays the test class that was selected in the Project area of the IDE.

### Run an Espresso test locally

Use the Project pane on the left side of the Android Studio IDE to run a Espresso test:

1. Navigate to the test you wish to run in the selected app module folder. The location of the test is determined by the instrumentation test root's location and the package name of the launched activity.

2. Right-click the test and select 'Run 'testName' from the menu. You may also open the test file and right-click on the created test method or class. On the Test Your App page, you can learn more about how to run tests.

3. Select the device on which you wish to perform the test in the Select Deployment Target dialog. Create a new Android Virtual Device if necessary. Click the OK button.
