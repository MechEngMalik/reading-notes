## Hibernate Many to Many

* The @ManyToMany annotation in Hibernate can be used to indicate this type of relationship.

* To summarize the many-to-many relationship, we will use an example. This example depicts the many-to-many relationship between two entities, employee and project.

* An employee can be allocated to numerous projects, and a project can have multiple people working on it, resulting in a many-to-many relationship.

* The employee and project tables, as well as the employee project join table with employee id and project id as foreign keys, must be created.

* The Maven dependencies and Hibernate configuration are then prepared. JPA annotations must be used to create the Model Classes: Employee and Project.

* The Employee and Project classes both refer to one another, indicating that the relationship is bidirectional.

* The @ManyToMany, @JoinTable, and @JoinColumn annotations are used to map a many-to-many relationship.

* In both classes, the @ManyToMany annotation is used to construct a many-to-many link between the entities.

* There are two sides to this association: the owning side and the inverse side.

* Because the owning side is Employee, the join table is defined in the Employee class using the @JoinTable annotation.

* The join/link table is defined by the @JoinTable. Employee Project is the name in this scenario.

* The @JoinColumn annotation is used to identify the primary table's join/linking column.

## Security: a humorous overview

* security researchers have a problem with public relations.

* a lighthearted summary It's almost as if security researchers have challenges with public relations because their websites make it impossible to achieve what you want.
* Experts in the field of security are constantly working to address security flaws and improve people's capacity to create more secure passwords
* Any password can be compromised. It's not a good idea to use the same password for everything. The threat model is used by security researchers to avoid security breaches by teaching people how to establish passwords and where security threats come from, albeit security breaches don't always come from obvious sources.
* There is no such thing as a perfect security system, and any security system will fail at some point.
