# **Wellcome To Git Tutorial**

## **first What is Version control**

*Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.*

## **Now what is the Git**

_**Git** is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project called **commit**  Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.**Git** mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.**Git** is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files._

Files in Git can reside in three main states:
* **committed**;* Data is securely stored in a local database.*
* **Modified**; *File has been changed but not committed to the database.*
* **staged**; *presented or performed on a stage*

### **Lets start the Git tutorial** ###

You can  create a copy of an existing Git repository from a particular server like **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**.

By cloning the file, you have copied all versions of all files for a project. This command leads to the creation of a directory called “test,” with an initialized .git directory inside it, which has copies of all versions of all files for the specified project. The command also automatically checks out — or retrieves for editing — a copy of the newest version of the project.

### **How it works**

### **what is raely happening inside**

_After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified because of changes made after the previous commit.
You stage the modified file.
Then, you commit staged changes_

## **coomand you need to get started**

**after changing what you want in the file , you can commit it by :**

[git commit -m “made change x,y,z”]

** Committing All Changes**

by using [git commit -a]

**you have after you finish to do A_C_P steps to make sure the edit will come **

## **Remoting**

You must interact with repositories or online versions of the project. Teams can use repositories to send information and pull data from it.
For cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the 'parent' name for the server you copied and the 'master' name for the local repositories.

**By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.**

**By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.**



## **Branching**

*By creating branches of a central repository, collaborators can work on a project simultaneously across multiple branches*
