_ **CSS** allows you to add appearance.
In the HTML module, it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, and paragraphs will break into a new line and leave a space between them. The links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you see is the browser's default styles without the proper look._

## **The Use Of CSS**
_**CSS** is a language for defining how to design and layout your website_

_The document is usually a text file structured using a markup language - HTML is the most common markup language._

_Presenting a document means converting it into a form that can be used by your audience. Browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome or Edge, are designed to visually present documents, for example, on a computer screen._

_**CSS** can be used to style the body of a document such as changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout as converting a single column of text into a layout with a main content space and sidebar of related information. It can even be used for effects like animation._

## **Adding CSS**
**There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:**

**1) External CSS:** _ change the look of an entire website by changing just one file_.

**2) Internal CSS:** _he internal style is defined inside the [<style>'] element, inside the head section_

**3) Inline CSS:** _An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element._

_To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property._
