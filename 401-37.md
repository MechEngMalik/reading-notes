# Amazon S3

+ Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an internet-based storage service. It's intended to make web-scale computing more accessible. + You may use Amazon S3's easy web services interface to store and retrieve any quantity of data, at any time, from any location on the internet.
+ A bucket is a storage container for Amazon S3 objects. Each item is housed within a bucket.

+ The fundamental entities saved in Amazon S3 are objects. Objects are made up of data and metadata. Amazon S3 is oblivious to the data component. The object's metadata is a collection of name-value pairs that describe it.

+ A key is an object's unique identification within a bucket. Each item in a bucket has only one key.

+ You have the option of selecting the AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the buckets you create.

+ For PUTs and DELETEs of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions, Amazon S3 delivers high read-after-write consistency.

## Advantages of using Amazon S3

+ Creating buckets: Create and name a data-storage bucket.

+ Data storage: A bucket can hold a limitless amount of data.

+ Data download: Download your data or give others permission to do so.

+ Permissions: Allow or disallow people from uploading or downloading data to your Amazon S3 bucket.

+ Standard interfaces: Use REST and SOAP interfaces that are based on industry standards and may be used with any internet development toolkit.

### S3 features

1. Storage classes: provides a variety of storage classes for various use cases.
2. Bucket policies: give you centralized access control over buckets and objects based on a range of criteria.
3. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): To manage access to your Amazon S3 resources, you can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
4. Access control lists: Use an access control list to manage access to each of your buckets and objects (ACL).
5. Versioning: To retain many versions of an object in the same bucket, utilize versioning.
6. Operations: There are numerous operations available, including:

+ Make a bucket — Make and name your own bucket to store your items in.

+ Write an object — Create or overwrite an object to store data. In the namespace of your bucket, you specify a unique key when you write an item. This is also a good moment to declare any object-level access controls.

+ Read an object – Retrieve data The data is available for download over HTTP.

+ Delete an object — Get rid of some of your information.

+ List keys — Make a list of the keys in one of your buckets. A prefix can be used to filter the key list.

### Provision backend storage

+ To start provisioning storage resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:

### amplify add storage

+ Enter the following when prompted:

```
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
    `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`
? You need to add auth (Amazon Cognito) to your project in order to add storage for user files. Do you want to add auth now?
    `Yes`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project:
    `S3friendlyName`
? Please provide bucket name:
    `storagebucketname`
? Who should have access:
    `Auth and guest users`
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket?
    `No`

    ```
* To push your changes to the cloud, execute the command:
amplify push

### Install Amplify Libraries
* Expand Gradle Scripts, open build.gradle (Module: app).

* Add these libraries into the dependencies block:

```

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:1.17.4'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.17.4'
}

```

### Initialize Amplify Storage
* To initialize the Amplify Auth and Storage categories you call Amplify.addPlugin() method for each category. To complete initialization call Amplify.configure().

* Add the following code to your onCreate() method in your application class:

```

Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());

```

### Uploading data to your bucket
* To upload to S3 from a data object, specify the key and the data object to be uploaded.

```

private void uploadFile() {
    File exampleFile = new File(getApplicationContext().getFilesDir(), "ExampleKey");

    try {
        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(exampleFile));
        writer.append("Example file contents");
        writer.close();
    } catch (Exception exception) {
        Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", exception);
    }

    Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
            "ExampleKey",
            exampleFile,
            result -> Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Successfully uploaded: " + result.getKey()),
            storageFailure -> Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Upload failed", storageFailure)
    );
}
