# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

**A Node-based data structure is referred to as a stack. Each Node refers to the Node after it in the stack, but not to the one before it.**


**Stacks are based on the following principles:**



>* FILO stands for First In, Last Out.

**This means that the last thing popped out of the stack will be the first item added to the stack.**



>* Last In First Out (LIFO)

**This means that the first thing pulled out of the stack will be the last item placed to it.**



**A stack is commonly referred to as:**

1 ) Push O(1)

_It will always be an O(1) operation to push a Node into a stack. This is because no matter how many Nodes (n) are on the stack, it takes the same amount of time._
>ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node

2 ) Pop O(1)
The action of removing a Node from the top of a stack is known as popping a Node. When a pop is performed, the top Node is reassigned to the Node below it, and the top Node is returned to the user.
>ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty
Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value


3 ) Peek O(1) 
 You will only inspect the top Node of the stack when doing a peek.
Before doing a peek, you should usually check isEmpty. This prevents an exception from being thrown. You can also encapsulate the call in a try/catch block.

For a sneak glance, here is the pseudocode
.
>ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value





## Queue

**A queue is commonly referred to as:**

* Nodes or items that are added to the queue are called **enqueues.**
* Nodes or items that are deleted from the queue are referred to as **dequeued**. When the queue is called
* **Front** - This is the queue's first/front Node.
* **Rear** - This is the queue's last and final Node.
* **Peek** - When you peek, you'll see the value of the queue's front Node. If the method is invoked while the queue is empty, an exception will be thrown.
* If the queue is empty, **IsEmpty** returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
