# Serverless and Amplify

## Serverless



>Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider manages server allocation and provisioning dynamically.

>A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-driven, ephemeral (lasting just one invocation), and controlled entirely by the cloud provider.



 its the right framework for that project you've been planning for a long time because pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity

### Traditional vs. Serverless Architecture

* In the past, apps ran on servers that you had to patch, update, and monitor late at night and early in the morning owing to all the unfathomable issues that disrupted your production.

* Serveless: users don't have to worry about the underlying servers any longer.

Because they are no longer handled by users, and because management is no longer involved, the obligation falls to the Cloud vendors.

### The Serverless App consist of:

+ Client Application — In a Modern Frontend Javascript App, the UI of your application is rendered client-side, allowing us to use a simple, static web server.

+ Web Server — Amazon S3 offers a reliable and easy-to-use web server.

+ Serverless architecture's primary enablers are Lambda functions (FaaS). AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions are three popular FaaS examples.

+ STS (Security Token Service) — creates temporary AWS credentials (API key and secret key) for app users.

+ User Authentication — AWS Cognito is a user authentication service that works with AWS Lambda. You can easily add user sign-up and sign-in to your mobile and online apps with Amazon Cognito.

+ Database — AWS DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database.


### AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is a collection of tools and services that may be used together or separately to assist front-end web and mobile developers in developing scalable full stack apps using AWS. You can configure app backends and link your app in minutes with Amplify, deploy static web apps in a few clicks with Amplify, and manage app content outside of the AWS console with Amplify.

*Benefits:*

1. Configure backends fast.

2. Seamlessly connect frontends.

3. Deploy in a few clicks.

4. Easily manage content.

### The GraphQL

The GraphQL Transform is a simple abstraction that allows you to easily develop backends for your web and mobile applications on Amazon Web Services. With the GraphQL Transform, you use the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) to specify your application's data model, and the library converts your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data mode.
> *Construct a GraphQL API*
amplify init can be found in the root of a JavaScript, iOS, or Android project.

* *Test the API*
To test some of these questions in your new API's query page, go to the AWS AppSync interface or run amplify mock api after the API has been deployed.

* *Update schema*

tOpen the backend/api/apiname/schema.graphql file in your project's backend/api/apiname/build folder (NOT the one in the backend/api/apiname/build folder) and change it in your favorite code editor to update your API. **amplify api gql-compile** can be used to compile the backend/api/apiname/schema.graphql.

* *API Category Project Structure*

The transform libraries turn a GraphQL schema defined in the Schema Definition Language (SDL) into a set of AWS CloudFormation templates and other assets that are deployed as part of amplification push. amplify/backend/api/YOUR-API-NAME/build contains the entire collection of assets that were submitted.
