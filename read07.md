# ** Control Flow**
_The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script._

_Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. _
## **Control flow and error handling**
_JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically control flow statements, that you can use to incorporate a great deal of interactivity in your application. This chapter provides an overview of these statements._
## **Type Of Statements**
* ### **Block statement**
* ### **Conditional statements:** _A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements:_

  **1) if else:** _Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false_

  **2) switch:** _A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and attempt to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is found, the program executes the associated statement._

##  JavaScript Functions
**a JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**

**a JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).**

**_A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().**

**Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).**

**The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)**

**The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}**
### **Function Invocation**
**The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:**

**_1) When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)_**

**2) _When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript_ **

**3) _Automatically (self invoked)_**
## **Advantage Of Functions**
**_you can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times._**

**_You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results._**
## **JavaScript Operators**
* **The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.**
* **The addition operator (+) adds numbers:**
* **The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.**
