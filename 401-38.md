## Amazon SNS?

Simple Notification Service by Amazon

Microservices and serverless applications benefit from pub/sub messaging. Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service that allows you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and event-driven serverless applications. It is highly available, durable, and secure. Topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging are available on Amazon SNS.

### Features and capabilities

The following are some of the features and capabilities offered by Amazon SNS:

* Deliver messages in a consistent and long-lasting manner. To offer high message durability, Amazon SNS uses cross availability zone message storage. Amazon SNS sends messages to valid AWS endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues and AWS Lambda functions, in a timely manner.

* Use Message Filtering to simplify your architecture. By removing the message filtering logic from your subscriber systems and the message routing logic from your publisher systems, Amazon SNS helps you simplify your pub/sub messaging architecture.

* Scale your workload automatically Amazon SNS makes use of the tried-and-true AWS cloud to dynamically scale with your app. Amazon SNS is a fully managed service that handles all capacity planning, provisioning, monitoring, and patching for you.

* Messages should be kept secret and safe. Topic owners on Amazon SNS can implement topic policies that limit who can publish and subscribe to their topics. Amazon SNS additionally encrypts data in transit and at rest, as well as offering VPC endpoints for message privacy.
