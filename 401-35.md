# Graphs



*A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be represented as a collection of vertices (or nodes) connected by edge segments.

## common terminology used when working with Graphs

1. Vertex - A vertex (sometimes referred to as a "node") is a data item with zero or more neighboring vertices.

2. Edge - An edge is a node-to-node connection.

3. Neighbor - A node's neighbors are its nearby nodes, which are linked by an edge.

4. Degree - A vertex's degree is the number of edges that link to it.

### Directed vs Undirected

* Undirected Graphs

>An undirected graph is one in which all of the edges are undirected or bi-directional. The undirected graph does not move in any direction as a result of this.

* Directed Graphs (Digraph)

>A Directed Graph, also known as a Digraph, is a graph with every edge directed in one direction.

### Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

1. Graphs come in a variety of shapes and sizes. This is dependent on how well the graphs are related to other nodes and vertices.

2. Completed, connected, and disconnected are the three categories.

#### Complete Graphs

When all nodes are connected to all other nodes, the graph is said to be complete.

#### Connected

A connected graph has at least one edge for each of its vertices/nodes.

#### Disconnected

A disconnected graph is one in which some of the vertices have no edges.

* In a graph data structure, standalone nodes or edges (also known as islands) are completely possible.

### Acyclic vs Cyclic

We have acyclic and cyclic graphs in addition to undirected and directed graphs.

#### Acyclic Graph

* A directed graph with no cycles is known as an acyclic graph.

* When a node may be traversed and potentially wind up back at itself, it is said to be in a cycle.

* A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is another name for a directed acyclic graph. This can also be portrayed as a tree, as we know it.

#### Cyclic Graphs

* A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.

* A cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.

### Graph Representation

We represent graphs through:

* Matrix of Adjacency
A 2-dimensional array is used to represent an adjacency matrix. We're dealing with a n x n Boolean matrix if there are n vertices.

Each vertex of the data structure is represented by a row and a column. If there is an edge connecting the two, the elements of both the column and the row must add up to 1, or zero if there isn't.

When there are few links in a graph, it is called a sparse graph. When there are a lot of connections in a graph, it's called a dense graph.

* An undirected graph will always be symmetric within an adjacency matrix. In the case of a directed graph, this is not the case.

* **Adjacency List**
* An adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs.

* An adjacency list is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

* Adjacency lists make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.

### Weighted Graphs

* A weighted graph is one in which the edges have been allocated numbers. These figures are referred to as weights.

* When representing a weighted graph in a matrix, you set the element in the 2D array to represent the actual weight between the two paths. If there is not a connection between the two vertices, you can put a 0, although it is known for some people to put the infinity sign instead.

* You must provide both the weight and the name of the next vertex in adjacency lists.

### Real World Uses of Graphs

* Graphs are extremely popular when it comes to itâ€™s uses. Here are just a few examples of graphs in use:
* GPS and Mapping
* Driving Directions
* Social Networks
* Airline Traffic
* Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
