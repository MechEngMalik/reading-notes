# **HTML Programming Languge**
## **Defintion**
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** _ is a code used to build a website and its content. You can structure content within a set of paragraphs, or by using images and spreadsheets._

**HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements that you use to embed or wrap different pieces of content to make them appear a certain way, or behave a certain way.**
## **Wireframe**
_ in the beganing you have to design your page, so **wirefram**  allows you to design an information hierarchy for your design of a website, application, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process the information on the site_

_When designing for a screen, you need to know where all the information is going before you create anything with an icon. Wireframing is also a great way to get a feel for how a user interacts with your interface_

## **From design to implementation**
_the process used to get to from wireframe to code, is less related to the individual preference of the UX Designer, and much more related to what approach the particular situation requires._

**different designers can structure the process from design to implementation by this ways:**
* **Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design**
* **Sketch > Code**
* **Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code**
* **Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code**

## **Dissection of HTML**

## ** Semantics**
_in programming, Semantics refers to the purpous of a piece of code and what effect does running that line of JavaScript have, or "what  role does that HTML element have_

_**In HTML, an example**_
_ **the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page".**_
