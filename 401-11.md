# Spring RequestMapping

## @RequestMapping — the HTTP Method

* Web requests are mapped to Spring Controller methods using this annotation.

* There is no default value for the HTTP method argument. So, if we don't give a value, any HTTP request will be mapped to it.

## RequestMapping and HTTP Headers

* @RequestMapping With the headers Attribute: By specifying a header for the request, the mapping can be restricted even further.

* @RequestMapping Consumes and Produces: Mapping media types created by a controller method requires extra care.

* Using the @RequestMapping headers, we can map a request based on its Accept header.

## RequestMapping With Path Variables

The @PathVariable annotation can be used to bind parts of the mapping URI to variables. If the name of the method argument exactly matches the name of the path variable, @PathVariable with no value can be used to simplify things.

* Several @PathVariable: For a more complex URI, multiple sections of the URI may need to be mapped to multiple values. @PathVariable with Regex: When mapping the @PathVariable, regular expressions can be used.

## RequestMapping With Request Parameters

* The @RequestParam annotation enables for easy mapping of URL parameters using @RequestMapping.

A request is now mapped to a URI:

* The parameters can be defined using @RequestMapping as an additional technique to filter the request mapping:

## RequestMapping Corner Cases

* @RequestMapping — Multiple Paths to a Single Controller Method
* While it is common to use a single @RequestMapping path value for a single controller function (this is just good practice, not a hard and fast rule), mapping numerous requests to the same method may be essential in some instances. In that situation, @RequestMapping's value attribute accepts many mappings rather than just one.

## Ambiguous Mapping Error

* The ambiguous mapping error happens when Spring compares two or more request mappings for different controller methods and finds them to be identical.


* When a request mapping has the same HTTP method, URL, arguments, headers, and media type, it is said to be the same.

## New Request Mapping Shortcuts

* In Spring Framework 4.3, a few new HTTP mapping annotations based on @RequestMapping were added:
* @GetMapping
* @PostMapping
* @PutMapping
* @DeleteMapping
* @PatchMapping

## Accessing Data with JPA

Describes the process of creating an application that stores and retrieves data from a relational database using Spring Data JPA.

## What You need

* A favorite text editor or IDE
* JDK 1.8 or later
* Gradle 4+ or Maven 3.2+

## Starting with Spring Initializr

* visit the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new project with the required dependencies (JPA and H2).

## Define a Simple Entity

* Creates a class containing members and a constructor, as well as getters and setters if desired.

* After that, add the @Entity annotation to the class.

* Then, as a data member, add an id annotated with @Id and @GeneratedValue with (strategy = GenerationType.Auto). This means that the id value will be created automatically.

* The default constructor must be stated in the entity.

* The arg-Constructor is used to construct and save objects in the database.

## Create Simple Queries

* Data from the Spring JPA is primarily concerned with storing data in a relational database.

* The ability to construct repository implementations automatically, at runtime, from a repository interface is its most enticing feature.

* The CrudRepository interface is extended by CustomerRepository.

* On CrudRepository, the type of entity and ID it works with, Customer and Long, are defined in the generic parameters.

* CustomerRepository inherits various methods for working with Customer persistence, including methods for saving, removing, and locating Customer entities, via extending CrudRepository.

* Spring Data JPA also allows you to declare the method signatures of other query methods.
