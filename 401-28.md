# RecyclerView

## Create dynamic lists with RecyclerView

* RecyclerView makes it simple to display vast amounts of data efficiently. You provide the data and define how each item should appear, and the RecyclerView library builds the elements as needed.

* It's a container for showing enormous datasets that can be browsed quickly while keeping the number of views to a minimum.

* It's a more complex and flexible variant of the GridView and ListView.

* For new items that have scrolled onscreen, RecyclerView reuses the view.

## Key classes

To create your dynamic list, you'll need to use several distinct classes.

* ViewGroup
* RecyclerView.ViewHolder
* RecyclerView.Adapter
* LayoutManager

## Steps for implementing your RecyclerView

IIf you're going to use RecyclerView, you'll need to accomplish the following:

1. First and foremost, decide on the layout of the list or grid. Normally, you'll be able to utilize one of the basic layout managers from the RecyclerView library.

2. Create a design for each list item's appearance and behavior. Extend the ViewHolder class based on this idea. Your ViewHolder version has all of the functionality for your list items. Your view holder is a wrapper for a View, and RecyclerView is in charge of that view.

3. Define the Adapter that associates your data with the ViewHolder views.

## Plan your layout

* A LayoutManager class arranges the elements in RecyclerView.
* Three layout managers are included in the RecyclerView library.
* The entries in a one-dimensional list are arranged by LinearLayoutManager.
All elements are arranged in a two-dimensional grid by GridLayoutManager (Vertically and Horizantaly)
* StaggeredGridLayoutManager: Items in a row do not have to have the same height, and items in the same column do not have to be the same width.

## Implementing your adapter and view holder

You must override three important methods while defining your adapter:

onCreateViewHolder() is a function that is called whenever a new view is created () This function is invoked by RecyclerView whenever a new ViewHolder is required.

onBindViewHolder() is a function that is called when the view is bound () To associate a ViewHolder with data, RecyclerView invokes this function.

* getItemCount() To get the size of the data collection, RecyclerView invokes this function.
