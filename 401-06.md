# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

## Object

* the object is a software package for associated behavior and state.
* Objects are for understanding object-oriented -programing technology.
* They all have behavior and status
* An object stores its state in fields (variables ) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions ).
* Methods operate on the internal state of an object and act as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
* Compiling code into individual programming objects provides a number of benefits, including:
  Modularity: The source code of an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code of other objects. The object can be easily passed within the system.
  * Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
  * Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.
  * Steganography: By interacting only with the object's methods, its internal implementation remain hidden from the world outside its own blueprint

## Class

* A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

**class declarations can include:**

* Modifiers such as public, private.
* The class name.
* The name of the class.
* The class body.

## What Is Inheritance?

* Different kinds of objects  have a certain amount in common with each other. 
* OOP allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.
* In the Java language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, but every superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses.
* Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software. 

## What Is an Interface?

* An interface is a a way to show the class to the outside world.
* When a class implements an interface, it  provide the behavior published by that interface. 
* interface allows the class to become more formal to the behavior it promises to provide

## What Is a Package?

* A package is a name to arrange classes and interfaces in a logical manner. 
* Placing the code into packages makes large software projects easier to work on manage . 
* The Java platform provides a huge number of class library suitable for  applications. 
* This library is known as the "Application Programming Interface". 
* Its packages represent the tasks most commonly associated with general-purpose programming. 
* The Java Platform API Specification contains the complete listing for all packages, interfaces, classes, fields, and methods supplied by the Java SE platform.
