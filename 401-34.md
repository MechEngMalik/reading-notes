# Monetization model for app

To sell digital goods or services within a Google Play app, use the billing system. Google Play's billing system makes it simple for customers to buy your app's goods and services in a consistent, safe, and seamless manner. Users can keep a payment method on Google Play and utilize it for all future purchases with a single tap.

In-app content must be sold through Google Play's billing system for developers that distribute their app through Google Play. The following items require developers to use Google Play's billing system:

Coins, gems, extra lives or turns, special items or equipment, characters or avatars, additional levels or playtime are examples of virtual gaming merchandise.

* App features or material, such as an ad-free version or new features not available in the free version.

* Subscription-based services including streaming media, digital periodicals, and social networking.

* Data storage services, business productivity software, and financial management software are all examples of cloud software solutions.

Google Pay is a service that allows you to sell tangible items or services.

To sell tangible items or services that are used or delivered outside of your app, utilize Google Pay. Google Pay gives your consumers a faster, safer way to pay online, in apps and anywhere else that accepts contactless payments. Accepting Google Pay simplifies your checkout process because customers won't have to enter their payment information each time they use your app or when they first download it.

## Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following

* Groceries, apparel, housewares, and electronics are examples of retail items.

* Physical services, such as taxi and transportation, cleaning, meal delivery, airfare, and event tickets.

* One-time or recurring membership payments, such as gym memberships, loyalty programs, or clubs that sell accessories, apparel, or other physical goods.

* Payment of bills via electronic means, such as credit card bills, utility bills, and cable or telecommunications services.
