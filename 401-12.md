# Working with Relationships in Spring Data REST

## Relationships in JPA

1. #### One-to-One RelationShip

* The @OneToOne annotation is used in Jpa to define this relationship.

* We can utilize @RestResources to personalize our end point if we want to.

* We utilize a repository interface to expose each entity in Jpa, which will extend from CRUD Repository or any of its children.

* If no post requests were received, a get request to an endpoint would return an empty object.

* To retrieve a JSON item, we use the PUT method, and to delete one, we use the Delete method.record.

```
>@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "secondary_address_id")
@RestResource(path = "libraryAddress", rel="address")
private Address secondaryAddress;
```

2. #### One-to-Many RelationShip

*In addition to many to one, one to many can be designated the same as one to one relationship.

* It can also have @RestResources, which can be used to configure endpoints. We'll need the same repository interface that extends CRUDRepository to expose it.

BookRepository extends CrudRepositoryBook, Long> "' public interface

* To associate the repository with the association, use the PUT request.

3. #### Relationship of Many-to-Many

* Is identical to the same as the previous realtionships.
* The @ManyToMany annotation is used to define a many-to-many relationship, to which we can add @RestResource.

## Testing the Endpoints With TestRestTemplate

## Integration Testing in spring

* Create a class that injects a TestRestTemplate into the application.
Endpoints should be defined as strings.
* To begin testing, declare the @Test function.
* For each class you want to test the relationship on, create an object.
* To get individual objects, use postEntity.
* To add the request's headers, use HttpHeaders.

## Spring MVC Test Configuration

* Using JUnit 5, enable Spring in your tests: JUnit 5 introduces an extension interface that allows classes to interact with JUnit tests.
* By adding the @ExtendWith annotation to our test classes and providing the extension class to load, we can enable this extension.
* SpringExtension.class is used to execute the Spring test.
* The @ContextConfiguration annotation is also required to load the context settings and bootstrap the context for our test.
* We supply the ApplicationConfig.class config class in @ContextConfiguration, which loads the configuration we require for this test.
* To specify the context configuration, we use a Java configuration class. We may utilize the XML-based setup in the same way

* Finally, we add the annotation @WebAppConfiguration to the test, which loads the web application context.
