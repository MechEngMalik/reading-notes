**JS It is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language and first-class functionality, popularly known as the scripting language for web pages, which used to design/program how web pages act when an event occurs. it is a dynamic scripting language that supports prototype-based object construction. TavaScript can act as both a procedural language and an object-oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to null objects at runtime, dynamic capabilities of javaScript include runtime object creation, parameter variable lists, and function variables.**
**JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that make you implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates.**

## **JavaScript variables:**
### **1) Numbers**
_JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals._

* var x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals

* var y = 3;       // A number without decimals

### **2) Strings**
_Strings store text. Strings are written inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:_
* var car = "BMW";  // Double quotes
* var car = 'BMW';  // Single quotes

### **3) Objects**
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values
This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:

* var car = {type:"BMW", model:"2020", color:"black"};

### **4) Arrays**
_JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable._
* var cars = ["Kia", "Toyota", "BMW"];


### **5) Functions**
_is a block of code designed to perform a particular task._

_A JavaScript function is executed when "something" (calls it)._

* function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;              // The function returns the product of p1 and p2}

## **Data Type**
**JS variables can be numbers like 10 and text values like "Mohammad".**

**JS can handle many types of data **
**In programming, text values are called text strings.** 

**Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.**
* **var pi = 3.14;**
* **var person = "Mohammad";**
* ** var answer = 'No!';**
