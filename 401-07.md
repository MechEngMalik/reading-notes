# OO Design

## SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design

**SOLID** stands for:

* S - Single-responsiblity Principle
* O - Open-closed Principle
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle
* I - Interface Segregation Principle
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## The Principle of Single-Responsibility

* A class should have only one reason to change, which means it should only have one job.

## The Principle of Open-Closed

* Objects or entities should be able to be extended but not modified.
* This means that a class should be able to be extended without requiring changes to the class itself.

## Substitution Principle of Liskov

* Let q(x) be a property that can be proved for objects of type T of x. Then, for objects y of type S, where S is a subtype of T, q(y) should be provable.
* Every subclass or derived class should be interchangeable with its base or parent class.

## Principle of Interface Segregation

* Clients should never be compelled to implement an interface they don't use, nor should they be forced to rely on methods they don't utilize.

## The Principle of Dependency Inversion

* Abstractions, not concretions, must be relied upon by entities. It specifies that the high-level module should rely on abstractions rather than the low-level module.

* Decoupling is possible thanks to this principle.

## In Real Life, the SOLID Principles

* A class or module should only accomplish one thing, according to the single responsibility principle (srp).

* Because this is somewhat subjective, the idea is reinforced by the heuristic that the class or module should only change for one reason.

* According to the open/closed principle, code entities should be extensible but not modifiable.

* To put it another way, you should build a class that does all it needs to do flawlessly rather than anticipating that someone would come in later and update it. It can't be changed, but it can be extended by inheriting from it and overriding or extending particular behaviors, for example.
The liskov substitution principle (lsp) is the most object-oriented programming-specific of them.

* The lsp simply states that any child type of a parent type should be able to stand in for that parent type without causing a meltdown.

* The interface segregation principle (isp) states that numerous smaller, client-specific interfaces should be preferred over a single larger, monolithic interface.

* In other words, you don't want to make people rely on services they don't require.

* The dependency inversion principle (dip) encourages you to develop code that is less concerned with concrete details and more concerned with abstractions.

* Look for a class or function that takes something general like "stream" and executes operations on it, rather than instantiating a specific filestream, stringstream, or whatever in the code you read. This offers the code a lot more flexibility: you can put anything that conforms to the stream abstraction in there and it will still work.
