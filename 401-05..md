# Linked Lists

* A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.
* Each Node references the next Node in the link.
* Linked List contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the line.
* There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly.
* Singly - A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node.
* Doubly - A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to the Next and Previous node.
* Node - Nodes are the individual links that live in a linked list.
* Next -  This property contains the reference to the next node.
* Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
* Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at.
* One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures.

## Traversal

* When traversing a linked list, its not able to use a foreach or for loop.
* We depend on the Next value in each node to locate where the next reference is pointing.
* The Next property it will lead us where the next node located and allow us to extract the data appropriately.
* The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop.
* When traversing through a linked list, the Current variable will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.

## Traversal Big O

* The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n).
* The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1).

## linear data structures

* is a sequence to how they are constructed and traversed.

## non-linear data structures

* items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

## Memory management

* The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory.
* when a linked list is invented, it doesn’t need 7 bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory , Linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory
