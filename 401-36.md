# Cognito

* With Cognito, you can quickly and easily add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your online and mobile apps.

## Configure Auth Category

Go to your project directory and run the following command to start provisioning auth resources in the backend:

>amplify add auth

* Enter the following when prompted:

```
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`

```

* Run the following command to push your modifications to the cloud:

>amplify push

### Install Amplify Libraries

* Include the following dependency in the build of your app. When prompted, run gradle with the others you added to Prerequisites and select "Sync Now":

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:1.17.4'
}
```

### Initialize Amplify Auth

* Before calling Amplify.configure, add the Auth plugin.

```
// Add this line, to include the Auth plugin.
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());
```

### Check the current auth session

* We can now check the status of the current authentication session.

* You can run this from the onCreate method of your MainActivity for testing reasons.

```
Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession(
    result -> Log.i("AmplifyQuickstart", result.toString()),
    error -> Log.e("AmplifyQuickstart", error.toString())
);

```

### Sign in

* The Auth category can be used to create a user, confirm attributes such as email and phone, and sign in with multi-factor authentication if desired. It's set up to handle users and their properties using Amazon Cognito User Pools.
