# Arrays,Loops,Imports

## Packages and Import

* Package => Directory
* Java classes can be bundled together
* The package name is the same as the name of the directory containing the .java files.

## Bundle announcement

* The package declaration must be the first statement, in the java source file.
* The default package. , it is possible to delete the package declaration even though all java classes are in the .

## Bundle Declaration Format

* The order of the account statement is as follows. Comments can go anywhere.
  * Package statement
  * Imports
  * Class or interface definitions.

* Importing all classes into a package does not make my object file (.class or .jar) larger
  The import only tells the compiler where to look for symbols.
* When categories are not used it is hard to remember to remove them, so import list is often wrong. It can slow down reading because unusual or unexpected imports of a class cause me to search for the wanted class, only to discover that it must have been used in an earlier version.
* Explicit class imports allow classes with names that conflict with standard library names to be defined in error. Using "*" to import all classes prevents this naming accident.

## Java Loops

* looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions we need until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false and exit the loop.

* Java provides multi types of loops for any programming need. Each loop has its own purpose and a it`s use case to serve.

* types of loops in Java:
  * for loop
  * for-each loop
  * Do-While loop
  * While loop

## For Loop

* A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

## While Loop

* The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement.
* It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.

## Do-While Loop

* The do-while loop works like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
