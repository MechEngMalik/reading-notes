# Hashtables

* Hash - A hash is the result of an algorithm that converts an entering string into a value that may be used for security or any other reason.

* Buckets - A bucket is the content of each index of the hashtable's array. Each index corresponds to a bucket.


* Collisions - A collision occurs when more than one key is hashed to the same hashtable position..

## The useage of Hashtables

1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

**Hashtables are a type of data structure that uses key-value pairs to store information. This means that each Node and Bucket has a key and a value.**

A hash is the ability to encode a key that will eventually map to a specific spot in the data structure that we can look at to retrieve the item directly.

* Hash maps take advantage of the O(1) read access of an array.

### Hashing 

* A hash code converts a string of characters into an integer.

* Traditionally, a hashtable is built from an array.

* The array's indexes can hold a variety of values.

#### Hash maps do this to store values

1. accept a key
2. calculate the hash of the key
3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
4. store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

#### Hash maps do this to read value

1. accept a key
2. calculate the hash of the key
3. use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
4. use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
5. search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given.
