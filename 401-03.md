# Maps, primitives, File I/O

## Java Type System

* Java has a two type system consisting of primitives and reference types

* Every primitive type corresponds to  reference type.
* the object has a single value of the corresponding primitive type.

## Pros and Cons

* The decision what object is to be used is depanding on what application performance we are making.
* available memory .
* the amount of available memory and what default values we should handle.

## Single Item Memory Footprint

* Reference types are relatively slow objects to access.
* We may use the Java Object Layout tool, to get the internal structure of the object.
* Variables of primitive type have the following effect on memory:
  * Boolean - 1 bit
  * Byte - 8 bit
  * short, char - 16 bits
  * Int, Float - 32 bit
  * Long, Double - 64 bits
  
* It turns out that one instance of a reference type on this JVM occupies 128 bits except for Long and Double which occupy 192 bits:
  * Boolean - 128 bits
  * Bytes - 128 bits
  * Short, Personal - 128 bits
  * Integer, Float - 128 bits
  * Long, Double - 192 bits

## array memory trace

* Types are grouped into four groups while memory depends on the number of elements in the array:
  * Long, double: m (s) = 128 + 64 seconds
  * short, letter: m(s) = 128 + 64 [s/4]
  * byte, boolean: m(s) = 128 + 64 [s/8]
  * Rest: m (s) = 128 + 64 [s/2]

## Performance
  
* Java code performance is a delicate issue, it largely depends on the hardware the code is running on, on the compiler, on the state of the machine, and on the activity of processes in the operating system.

## default values

* The default values ​​for primitive types are 0, for numeric types, false for the boolean type, \u0000 for the character type. For wrapper classes, the default value is null.
* Reference types may acquire a (null) value that does not belong to their scopes in some sense.

## Usage

* the primitive types are much faster and require much less memory.
* On the other hand, current Java language specification doesn't allow usage of primitive types in the parametrized types (generics),  in the Java collections or the Reflection API.

## Conclusion

* objects in Java are slower and have a bigger memory impact than their primitive analogs.

## Exceptions

* The Java programming language uses exceptions to handle errors.

The term exception is an "exceptional event", an event that occurs during program execution, and that disrupts the normal flow of program instructions.

* When an error occurs inside a method, the method creates an object and delivers it to the runtime system.
* The object, called the exception object, contains the error information, its type and the state of the program when it occurred.
* Creating an exception object and delivering it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.

## The Catch or Specify Requirement

* Valid Java programming language code must be in Specify Requirement.
* which means that code that might throw spacific exceptions must be enclosed by the following:

  * A try statement that catches the exception, must provide a handler for the exception.
  * A method that specifies that it can throw the exception.

* **Type of Exceptions**

  1. the checked exception. These are exceptional conditions that a good-written application should notice and recover from.
  2. The error. These are exceptional conditions that are related to the application, and that the application usually cannot notice or recover from.
  3. The runtime exception. These are exceptional situation that are inside the application, and the application usually cannot notice or recover from.

## Scanning

* Scanner-type objects are useful for splitting formatted inputs into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.
