# Save data in a local database using Room

Apps that deal with large volumes of structured data can considerably benefit from storing that data locally. The most typical use case is to cache relevant portions of data so that the user may still explore that information while the device is not connected to the internet.

The Room persistence library acts as an abstraction layer over SQLite, allowing for fluent database access while still utilizing SQLite's full functionality. Room, in particular, offers the following advantages:

* SQL query verification at compile time.

* Convenience annotations that reduce boilerplate code that is repetitive and error-prone.

* Database migration paths have been simplified.

## Primary components

Room is made up of three major components:

* The database class holds the database and is the primary access point for the underlying connection to the persisted data in your app.

* Tables in your app's database are represented by data entities.

* DAOs are data access objects that give methods for your app to query, update, insert, and delete data from a database.

### Database

The AppDatabase class is defined in the following code to hold the database. AppDatabase is the app's main access point to the persisted data and determines the database setup. The database class has to meet the following requirements:

* A @Database annotation must be added to the class, which includes an entities array that lists all of the database's data entities.


* The class must extend RoomDatabase and be an abstract class.

* The database class must specify an abstract method with zero arguments that returns an instance of the DAO class for each DAO class linked with the database.

### Entity

Room utilizes the class name as the database table name by default. Set the tableName property of the @Entity annotation if you wish the table to have a different name. Similarly, Room defaults to using the field names as column names in the database. Add the @ColumnInfo annotation to the field and set the name attribute if you want a different name for a column. Custom names for tables and columns are demonstrated in the following example:

```

@Entity(tableName = "users")
public class User {
    @PrimaryKey
    public int id;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "first_name")
    public String firstName;

    @ColumnInfo(name = "last_name")
    public String lastName;
}
```

### Index specific columns

If your app needs to support SDK versions that don't support FTS3 or FTS4 table-backed entities, you can still index some database columns to speed up queries. Include the indices property within the @Entity annotation, listing the names of the columns you want to include in the index or composite index, to add indices to an entity.

### Include AutoValue-based objects

When utilizing @AutoValue classes as entities, you can use @PrimaryKey, @ColumnInfo, @Embedded, and @Relation to annotate the class's abstract methods. However, you must include the @CopyAnnotations annotation each time you use these annotations so that Room can properly comprehend the methods' auto-generated implementations.

## Define relationships between objects

* Intermediate data class

You construct a data class that models the relationship between your Room instances in the intermediate data class approach. As embedded objects, this data class stores the pairings between instances of one entity and instances of another entity. The instances of this data class can then be returned by your query methods for use in your program.

* Multimap return types

You don't need to declare any additional data classes when using the multimap return type technique. Instead, you declare a multimap return type for your method depending on the map structure you want, and the link between your entities is defined directly in your SQL query.

### Accessing data with Room

You can define each DAO as either an interface or an abstract class. For basic use cases, you should usually use an interface. In either case, you must always annotate your DAOs with @Dao

**types of DAO methods that define database interactions:**

* Convenience methods for inserting, updating, and deleting rows in a database without having to write SQL code.
* Database methods are query methods that allow you to interact with the database by writing your own SQL query.

#### Insert

* The @Insert annotation enables you to create methods that insert their parameters into the database's appropriate table.

* @Insert method must ben instance of a Room data entity class annotated with @Entity or a collection of data entity class instances must be passed to the @Insert method.

#### Update

* You can use the @Update annotation to create methods that update individual rows in a database table. @Update methods, like @Insert methods, accept data entity instances as parameters.

#### Delete

The @Delete annotation allows you to define methods that delete specific rows from a database table. Similarly to @Insert methods, @Delete methods accept data entity instances as parameters.

#### Query methods

The @Query annotation allows you to write SQL statements and expose them as DAO methods.
