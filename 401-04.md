# Object-Oriented Programming

## Object

* the object is a software package for associated behavior and state.
* Objects are for understanding object-oriented -programing technology.
* They all have behavior and status
* An object stores its state in fields (variables ) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions ).
* Methods operate on the internal state of an object and act as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
* Compiling code into individual programming objects provides a number of benefits, including:
  Modularity: The source code of an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code of other objects. The object can be easily passed within the system.
  * Code re-use: If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.
  * Pluggability and debugging ease: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.
  * Steganography: By interacting only with the object's methods, its internal implementation remain hidden from the world outside its own blueprint

## Class

* A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

**class declarations can include:**

* Modifiers such as public, private.
* The class name.
* The name of the class.
* The class body.



## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

* Decimals: Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is what,Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller
* Bases: The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10.
* Binary Numbers: are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits
* Hexadecimal Numbers: there are 16 of them.They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.
