# Trees

A tree is a non-linear data structure that organizes data elements based on hierarchical relationships. The Java Collection Framework has two built-in classes, TreeSet and TreeMap, that allow programmers to define data components in the aforementioned format.

## Common Terminology

A Tree node is a component that can have its own values as well as pointers to other nodes.

* Root - The root is the very first node in the tree.

* K - In a k-ary tree, this value determines the maximum number of children a node can have. k = 2 in a binary tree.

* Left - In a binary tree, a pointer to one child node.

* Right - In a binary tree, a reference to the other child node.

* Edge - In a tree, an edge connects a parent and a child node.

* Leaf - A node with no children is called a leaf.

* Height - The number of edges from the base to the farthest leaf determines a tree's height.

## Depth First

When using depth first traversal, we emphasize traveling through the tree's depth (height) first. There are several methods for performing depth first traversal, each of which alters the order in which we search for/print the root. Here are three strategies for traversing depth first:

* Pre-order: root >> left >> right
* In-order: left >> root >> right
* Post-order: left >> right >> root

## Breadth First

* use of the queue

* The breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by node-by-node traversing each level of the tree.

## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

* Each node in a tree can have any number of children, however Binary Trees limit the number of offspring to two (hence our left and right children).

* We name the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree if nodes can have more than two child nodes.
